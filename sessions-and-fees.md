It is important for you to find the right counsellor to work with. I offer a one hour introductory consultation costing £{{ site.fee_consultation }}, at the end of which you can decide whether or not to proceed with further sessions.

Each subsequent session will then last one hour. The standard fee for one hour is **£{{ site.fee }} per session**, payable at the end of each session by cash or cheque. A limited number of concessions may be available for students and those on low incomes. I also offer a reduced rate for trainee counsellors.

Missed appointments or cancelled sessions are chargeable in full, apart from exceptional circumstances when an agreed portion of the fee will be payable. Further sessions are booked on a session-by-session basis. Counselling can be short- or long-term depending on your needs and goals.

Sessions usually take place once a week, however this can and does change according to the individual needs of the client.

Sessions take place at The Plymouth Natural Health and Healing Centre, or in one of the therapy rooms at the Abbey Mead Natural Health Centre in Tavistock. I am flexible regarding days and appointment times.

The therapy centres all have free parking outside the premises.
