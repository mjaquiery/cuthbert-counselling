I hold an Advanced Diploma in Therapeutic Supervision.

I see supervision as a joint endeavour in which the supervisor works with the supervisee to improve the quality of their work, continuously developing themselves and their practice.

My aim is to promote and safeguard the well-being of both my supervisees and the people they work with. Therapy is demanding and rewarding work. I help my supervisees grow and learn, build their confidence and competency and celebrate their successes. I offer a valuing and nourishing presence which allows reflection, exploration, challenge and insight to take place in an affirming, creative and good humoured manner. I will work with you in a way that meets your needs and is appropriate to your level of training and experience.

I am an experienced MBACP registered Integrative Counsellor. Although I was trained in a humanistic modality, I employ a wide range of approaches and perspectives in my work. I am also a qualified Teacher with an extensive background in learning support. In addition I work as a Spiritual Director / Accompanier.

I have consulting rooms in both Plymouth and Tavistock.
