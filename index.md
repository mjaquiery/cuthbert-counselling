Are you looking for a counsellor or wondering whether counselling might help you?

Counselling can help when we feel things are going wrong with our lives. Counselling can help us to understand the things that are going wrong and to work out what we can do to deal with them.

Life can be very complex, busy and demanding. We may feel we do not have the space to explore what is happening. We may not think we have a trusted person with whom we can share our personal, and possibly painful, experience.

Seeking counselling is not a sign of weakness. In counselling you build a trusting relationship with your counsellor who will help you address the issues you want to face. Counselling requires courage and commitment, and choosing the right counsellor to work with is crucial.

My name is Alison and I offer counselling services in Tavistock and in Plymouth, Devon. I am a fully-qualified Integrative Counsellor with experience in dealing with a wide range of clients and issues. I offer face-to-face counselling and email counselling.
