_How do I begin?_

We begin with an initial consultation session. At this meeting we explore why you have decided on counselling. I explain my confidentiality policy and I ask you to fill in an 'intake form' so I have your contact details, etc. By the end of this session we will have decided whether or not to proceed with further sessions.

_Where do the sessions take place?_

I offer sessions in Tavistock and Plymouth. Tavistock sessions are held in a private room in [Abbey Mead Natural Health Centre](http://www.abbey-mead.co.uk/index.html) and Plymouth sessions are held at [Plymouth Natural Health and Healing Centre](http://plymouthnaturalhealth.org.uk/) in Plymouth.

_When are appointments available?_

I will try to provide an appointment time which is convenient for you. Daytime and evening appointments may be available in Tavistock throughout the week. If you would like an appointment in Plymouth instead, please [contact me](/contact) to ask about availability.

_How much will it cost?_

The initial one hour consultation costs £{{ site.fee_consultation }}. The fee for each subsequent one hour session is £{{ site.fee }}. A limited number of concessions are available for students and those on low incomes.

_How do I make an appointment?_

You can make an appointment by [email](mailto:{{ site.email }}) or by calling me on {{ site.phone }}.

_How long are the sessions?_

The sessions are one hour long.

_How often will I have sessions?_

Usually counselling begins with regular weekly sessions.

_How many sessions will I need?_

Counselling can be short-term or long-term. The number of sessions that you will need is something which will depend upon the issues you want to address. You can choose to end counselling at any time.

_What is the cancellation policy?_

Missed appointments or cancelled sessions are chargeable in full, apart from in exceptional circumstances where an agreed portion of the fee will be payable.

_What about confidentiality?_

I have a confidentiality policy and will explain the policy in detail at the initial consultation session. Information will not be disclosed to others outside the therapeutic setting without the client's knowledge and consent, except in rare legal circumstances or where there is a serious risk of actual harm to the client or others.
